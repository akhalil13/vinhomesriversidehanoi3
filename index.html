<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">It doesn't matter if you are in Vietnam for business or pleasure, make yourself at home during your stay in Ho Chi Minh.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<big>Ho Chi Minh city is the most important economic center in Vietnam.
It's located on the banks River Saigon, 60km from South China Ocean and
1,760km towards the south capital Hanoi. Ho Chi's rich cultural and
historic heritage has attracted many visitors throughout the years.
Many visitors come to work while others visit as college students. It
is also home to a vibrant business district that is surrounded with
small towns, which together have 9 million inhabitants.<br />
<br />
<br />

Finding the right place and environment is crucial if you want to feel
at home immediately. The idea of having your own "comfort area" where
you can make your own meals and invite others over is not something
you'll find in hotels. Most expats, as well as long-term business
travelers, prefer to rent rooms for their accommodation. As a rule, a 3
month deposit must be made when signing a lease contract with a
landlord. In certain cases, the tenant may need to pay a 6 month
advance. The tenant may also need to pay extra utilities like garbage
collection, internet connection, or cable TV. </big><big> </big><big> </big><big><a href="https://vinhomesriversidehanoi.com/cho-thue-biet-thu-vinhomes-riverside/" target="_blank">thuê biệt thự Vinhomes Riverside</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </big><big>While
furnished homes are available all over the city, many are made
according to the owner’s preferences and personal tastes in furniture.
If you plan to stay for the long-term, you can negotiate with landlords
of unfurnished properties to buy your private furniture and property.
However, this decision is dependent on the length of your stay. Tap
water is safe to use in cleaning dishes and brushing teeth, but it's
not recommended for drinking. Bottled water can be ordered from local
retailers or delivered to your door.<br />

Facilities<br />
<br />
These apartments are available for rent in Ho Chi Minh and offer modern
facilities like internet access, satellite television and private
balconies. Many properties for rent are elegantly designed and provide
comfort to tenants. The facilities available to tenants include a
swimming pool, business centre and a fitness center. Some properties
have separate living areas with DVD players, plasma TVs, and leather
sofas. The kitchen also has gas stoves, which can be used to make your
own food. Luxurious tubs make it possible to relax in the luxurious
en-suite bathrooms. Management can arrange for a daily breakfast
service in serviced apartments if you request.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is possible to rent apartments in a nearby rental apartment. This is
ideal for anyone who needs to travel frequently throughout the country
or South-East Asia region. Look for accommodations that are
pet-friendly and provide play areas for your children, if you plan on
traveling with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Visitors need to have a valid Visa in order to enter Vietnam. This visa
(valid for three months) can be obtained on arrival at an international
Vietnam airport. In the case of a foreigner coming to work, they can
request these travel documents from the sponsoring agency. Also, an
assignment letter or passport is required for a 3-6-month vocational
visa. To be able to identify themselves, visitors must register
immediately upon arrival at the local Consulate.<br />

Your main concerns when selecting the best houses to rent Ho Chi Minh should be security and proximity. </big><big> </big><big> <a href="https://vinhomesriversidehanoi.com/cho-thue-biet-thu-vinhomes-riverside/" target="_blank">cho thuê biệt thự Vinhomes Riverside</a></big>&nbsp;&nbsp; <big>Most
expats prefer to live in close-knit areas where they feel safe and
secure. Phu My Hung in District 7 and Thao Dien in District 2 are
examples. The city has many villas that are spacious and
well-maintained. Before you travel to the city, make sure you do an
online search for quality properties.<br />
